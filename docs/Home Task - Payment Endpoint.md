# Take-Home Task - Payment Endpoint

## The context

We build an online shop. The shop sells physical products.

A user adds products to a cart. The user then pays for the cart with a credit card.

We already have these parts of the system:

- The user account, with an id, email and a name.
- The cart, with the products that the user selected.
- Payment total calculation service. You don’t need to calculate how much to pay.
- The payment details of the user. Each user has a card token from our payment provider.

You must build the payment part.

## What to make

1. **A SQL schema** for the payment part of the system.
2. **An HTTP endpoint** that starts the payment for a cart.

## Rules

- Use Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy.
- Use PostgreSQL for the database.
- Use the following base schema:

Quick-start SQL schema

- You do not have to connect to a real payment provider. A mock function is enough. The mock can succeed or fail - you decide how.
- Write tests for the endpoint.
- Put the code in a Git repository. Add a README that tells us how to run the code and the tests.

If a requirement is not clear, use your best judgment. Write your assumptions in the README.

## How to send us your work

### ***What should you expect after the completion of a test task?***

- Your test task will be reviewed by our Technical Specialist;
- We will return with the results as soon as possible;
- In order to avoid sharing solutions between candidates - we don’t provide detailed feedback on your test task submission after our review (we don’t point at any issues found).

***Please contact us in case of any queries and let us know if you have any additional questions.***
